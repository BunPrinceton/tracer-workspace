Morphology
Shape can be great

Dendrites
Spines are fine


Here we have several spines


Dendrites are usually larger than axons and have many protrusions called spines
Spines almost always end in a synapse with an axon
There are cases where spines can end synapsing in other ways
Dendrites tend to branch out in acute angles

Glial Cell

Glial Cell

Glial Cell


Glial cells act as a support to other cells
They can range in size shape and length, from very large to very slim, curvy and straight, lengthy and suddenly truncated
They curve and cup dendrites and axons expanding in all directions
We don’t trace Glia cells at this time
If you are doing a task with a glial cell just send it to the Uncertain Tab (referred to on the Left Hand Side Buttons list)

Axon
EM View
The way this axon crosses the image is called 
"parallel to the sectioning plane" or just "parallel to the plane"


Perpendicular and parallel side by side

Axons going in the same direction

Axons going in the same direction

Axons almost always exit a volume (cube)
Axons can range in size from very thin to medium sized and even thicker than dendrites
Axons can have clusters of dense vesicles
Axons tend to flow together in groups going approximately the same direction
Axons tend to branch in obtuse angles

Mergers
Those who merger together get purged together

Here we observe a large merger between an axon and a spine of a dendrite

Here we have an AI merger spilling outside its boundaries a bit

Same AI Spill Merger

EM View
AI Spill Merger

Here we have a long spine (circled in red) merged with a glial cell

Here we have a yellow spine being cut off from its red                   stem

Here we have a small merger attached to the stem of the spine

Here we have a red spine that should end at the rounded part

Two heavy duty dendrites merged together

Anatomical Clues
We got clues to use

Synapses
Synapse Crackle Pop

Here we have some classic synapses

We have a sneaky little mitochondria

The dark part is called the synaptic cleft

And tons of vesicles

What can we assume from this picture during a tracing of these synapses?

Bingo! It’s likely the (1s) are axons and (2s) are spines (dendrites)

Mitochondria
Their powerlevel is over 9000!

Mitochondria and an exclusive MVB

Synapse and Mitochondria

Synapse plus Mitochondria

More Mitochondria

Mitochondria can appear in axons, glia, and dendrites
Mitochondria have been seen located around synapses

Vesicles
You may need spectacles to view the vesicles

Here we have a bunch of dense vesicles. They tend to cluster around synapses.

Can you spot the vesicles!?

You did it!

Vesicles are little black, gray, and white circles that send/receive neurotransmitters
Vesicles can most easily be found in dense clusters around the synapse in an axon
Vesicles can be in axons, glia, and dendrites though typically we find them most often in axons

Bugs and Problems
What is this? A center for bugs? It needs to be at least three times as big!

Slide Damage
Damage? More like unknown advantage!

I call this kind of error, a Cheese Pizza

Because it looks like a Domino's Pizza!

A friendly circle of damage

Sometimes whole slides turn to the darkside - like this one here

Sometimes slides will have a long dark line through them

More slide damage
Pew Pew Pew
Shots fired! =D

More slide damage


Rendering Issues

Are there more parallel plane or perpendicular plan axons!?
Dendrites are big and have things called spines
I do it fast. I do it slow. We do it together. Then you go.

Misc

A vector is a line, three together makes an axis.

A weird synapse thing
Double synapse or perhaps?
